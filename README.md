# Liver Cirrhosis Stage Detection using Machine Learning

The Liver Cirrhosis Stage Detection is a Machine Learning application designed to predict the stage of liver cirrhosis in patients based on various clinical and laboratory features. The application allows users to upload a dataset manually through an interactive interface. The project utilizes a Random Forest classifier to analyze the importance of different features, such as age, sex, bilirubin levels, and other relevant clinical factors, in determining the stage of liver cirrhosis. After training, the model provides predictions on the severity of the disease and highlights the most influential factors contributing to these predictions. This tool is useful for both clinical practitioners and researchers in understanding the progression of liver cirrhosis and can be easily deployed via a user-friendly interface.
